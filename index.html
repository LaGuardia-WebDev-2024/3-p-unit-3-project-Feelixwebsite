  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Rinse the whole pluck in cold water. Trim off any large pieces of fat and cut away the windpipe
  </p>
  <p>Place in a good sized pot and cover with cold water. The lungs float, so keep submerged with a plate or a lid. Bring to the boil and skim the surface regularly. Gently simmer for 2 hours</p>
  <p id="meat">
    Lift the meat from the pot with tongs or a slotted spoon, and rinse in cold water to remove any scum. Place into a bowl and leave to cool</p>
  <p>Strain cooking liquid through a fine sieve and put back on the stove to reduce until you have roughly 500â€“1 of stock. Leave to cool</p>
  <p>Whilst the stock reduces, finely dice the cooked heart and lungs. Grate the liver using the coarse side of the grater. Finely dice the trimmings. Mix together in a large bowl, along with the suet, oatmeal and spices</p>
  <p>Season, tie into ox bung, cook and serve- you can freeze any extra!</p>
